    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for a classic, unadorned latke; no kohlrabi or cumin here. Serve them hot and make more than you
        think you need. They go fast.</p>
    <p>I've used this recipe for years, but with one trick: brush each side with oil, flatten and bake in a 425 oven
        until crisp on both sides. You can do all of them at once and not have used oil to deal with later. They come
        out crispy and perfect each time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Russet potatoes </li>
        <li>1 Large Onion</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour and Baking Poweder</li>
        <li>Pepper and Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
